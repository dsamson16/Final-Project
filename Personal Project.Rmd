-   Ensure you are viewing the app at full screen by expanding the window.

**Tab 2:** Full Time Series tab has the entire Souvenir data set available on a histogram available to view.

**Tab 3:** Plot Choices, allows the user to break down the Souvenirs data set by viewing the Decomposition, Autocorrelation, and seasonality.

-   Under "Please select a plot to view:" select the type of plot you would like to view and click the action button labelled "Submit"
-   For best viewing expand page to full page.

**Tab 4:** Date Range Decomposition's, allows the user to specify which years they would like to view decomposed.

-   Under "Input Starting Year" type a year that is within the data collected range (1989-1993)

-   Under "Input Ending Year" type a year greater then the input starting year and less then the maximum data collected range (1989-1993)

**Tab 5:** Interpretations, are detailed analysis of all of the different plots created within the App

**Tab 6:** Simple Models: created to see which forecasting feature would best predict the next souvenir sale year.

-   Select model from the choices: Naive, Linear Model, Seasonal Naive, Drift, Mean and simple Exponential smoothing.

-   Once the model is selected adjust the slider bar to display the total number of months foretasted.

-   \*\* More then one model can be selected at the same time\*\*

**Tab 7:** Exponential Smoothing: Created to show the difference between forecasting based off of trend versus Trend and seasonality.

-   Select model from the choices: Holt and Holt Winters
